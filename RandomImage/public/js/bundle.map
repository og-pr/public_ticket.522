The only way\n * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n *\n * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n * necessary\n *\n * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n *\n * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n * events.\n *\n * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n *\n * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n * for the dismissal of the keyboard.

It analyzes\n * the geometry of elements, and observes when another responder (scroll view\n * etc) has stolen the touch lock. It notifies your component when it should\n * give feedback to the user. (bouncing/highlighting/unhighlighting).\n *\n * - When a touch was activated (typically you highlight)\n * - When a touch was deactivated (typically you unhighlight)\n * - When a touch was \"pressed\" - a touch ended while still within the geometry\n *   of the element, and no other element (like scroller) has \"stolen\" touch\n *   lock (\"responder\") (Typically you bounce the element).\n *\n * A good tap interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should be a\n * slight delay before showing a highlight when starting a touch. If a\n * subsequent touch move exceeds the boundary of the element, it should\n * unhighlight, but if that same touch is brought back within the boundary, it\n * should rehighlight again. A touch can move in and out of that boundary\n * several times, each time toggling highlighting, but a \"press\" is only\n * triggered if that touch ends while within the element's boundary and no\n * scroller (or anything else) has stolen the lock on touches.\n *\n * To create a new type of component that handles interaction using the\n * `Touchable` mixin, do the following:\n *\n * - Initialize the `Touchable` state.\n *\n *   getInitialState: function() {\n *     return merge(this.touchableGetInitialState(), yourComponentState);\n *   }\n *\n * - Choose the rendered component who's touches should start the interactive\n *   sequence. On that rendered node, forward all `Touchable` responder\n *   handlers. You can choose any rendered node you like. Choose a node whose\n *   hit target you'd like to instigate the interaction sequence:\n *\n *   // In render function:\n *   return (\n *     <View\n *       onStartShouldSetResponder={this.touchableHandleStartShouldSetResponder}\n *       onResponderTerminationRequest={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminationRequest}\n *       onResponderGrant={this.touchableHandleResponderGrant}\n *       onResponderMove={this.touchableHandleResponderMove}\n *       onResponderRelease={this.touchableHandleResponderRelease}\n *       onResponderTerminate={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminate}>\n *       <View>\n *         Even though the hit detection/interactions are triggered by the\n *         wrapping (typically larger) node, we usually end up implementing\n *         custom logic that highlights this inner one.\n *       </View>\n *     </View>\n *   );\n *\n * - You may set up your own handlers for each of these events, so long as you\n *   also invoke the `touchable*` handlers inside of your custom handler.\n *\n * - Implement the handlers on your component class in order to provide\n *   feedback to the user. See documentation for each of these class methods\n *   that you should implement.\n *\n *   touchableHandlePress: function() {\n *      this.performBounceAnimation();  // or whatever you want to do.\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressIn: function() {\n *     this.beginHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey activation\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressOut: function() {\n *     this.endHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey deactivation\n *   },\n *\n * - There are more advanced methods you can implement (see documentation below):\n *   touchableGetHighlightDelayMS: function() {\n *     return 20;\n *   }\n *   // In practice, *always* use a predeclared constant (conserve memory).\n *   touchableGetPressRectOffset: function() {\n *

In general, this should only really be used if you need more flexibility than\n * `FlatList` provides, e.g. for use with immutable data instead of plain arrays.\n *\n * Virtualization massively improves memory consumption and performance of large lists by\n * maintaining a finite render window of active items and replacing all items outside of the render\n * window with appropriately sized blank space. The window adapts to scrolling behavior, and items\n * are rendered incrementally with low-pri (after any running interactions) if they are far from the\n * visible area, or with hi-pri otherwise to minimize the potential of seeing blank space.\n *\n * Some caveats:\n *\n * - Internal state is not preserved when content scrolls out of the render window. Make sure all\n *   your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.\n * - This is a `PureComponent` which means that it will not re-render if `props` remain shallow-\n *   equal. Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop\n *   (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on\n *   changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.\n * - In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously\n *   offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate ands momentarily see\n *   blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application,\n *   and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.\n * - By default, the list looks for a `key` prop on each item and uses that for the React key.\n *   Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.\n *\n */\nvar VirtualizedList =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction (_React$PureComponent) {\n  _inheritsLoose(VirtualizedList, _React$PureComponent);\n\n  var _proto = VirtualizedList.prototype;\n\n  // scrollToEnd may be janky without getItemLayout prop\n  _proto.scrollToEnd = function scrollToEnd(params) {\n    var animated = params ? params.animated : true;\n    var veryLast = this.props.getItemCount(this.props.data) - 1;\n\n    var frame = this._getFrameMetricsApprox(veryLast);\n\n    var offset = Math.max(0, frame.offset + frame.length + this._footerLength - this._scrollMetrics.visibleLength);\n    /* $FlowFixMe(>=0.53.0 site=react_native_fb,react_native_oss) This comment\n     * suppresses an error when upgrading Flow's support for React.

Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop\n *   (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on\n *   changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.\n * - In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously\n *   offscreen.

Make sure all\n *   your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.\n * - This is a `PureComponent` which means that it will not re-render if `props` remain shallow-\n *   equal. Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop\n *   (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on\n *   changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.\n * - In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously\n *   offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate and momentarily see\n *   blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application,\n *   and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.\n * - By default, the list looks for a `key` prop on each item and uses that for the React key.\n *   Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.\n *\n */\nvar SectionList =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction (_React$PureComponent) {\n  _inheritsLoose(SectionList, _React$PureComponent);\n\n  function SectionList() {\n    var _this;\n\n    for (var _len = arguments.length, args = new Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n      args[_key] = arguments[_key];\n    }\n\n    _this = _React$PureComponent.call.apply(_React$PureComponent, [this].concat(args)) || this;\n\n    _this._captureRef = function (ref) {\n      /* $FlowFixMe(>=0.53.0 site=react_native_fb,react_native_oss) This comment\n       * suppresses an error when upgrading Flow's support for React.
